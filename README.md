- 👋 Hi, I’m @AskDrP
- 👀 I’m a human development professor interested in learning how to develop games for adults to explore life and the challenges of being alive.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to be patient and not be totally overwhelmed by the programming options for life outside a structured LMS.  I've lived in Canvas and Blackboard for far too long!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple gaming applications (low stakes interactive app) that I can host on my own.
- 📫 How to reach me psabbottenz@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: she/hers/mom
- ⚡ Fun fact: I build my first computer in 1978 when floppy disks were still floppy, and I remember punch carsds.  The last programming language I ever learned was HTML.  So, here I am as an OG tech mamma, looking for support and guidance from the next gen of tech.
